# My-Reads

This is my final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course, developed by [React Training](https://reacttraining.com). 

In this project you have a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read.

## Install

```node
npm install
```
This command will install required resources and third party libraries.

## Execute
```node
npm start
```

This command will start up a server where you can test the app. 
Typically on 
```
http://localhost:8080
```
